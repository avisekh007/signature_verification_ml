You need Upload the Kaggle API token when the Google Colab notebook asks for it.
My API Token file is kaggle.json.
This is required to download the dataset directly into Colab working directory.
You can also create and upload your own Kaggle API token by: https://www.kaggle.com/ > Your Profile Pic > Account > API > Create API Token
Create your new token if my token doesn't works (probably expired).
